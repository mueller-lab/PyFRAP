   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to PyFRAP's API!
==================================

PyFRAP is a extensive Python based FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching) analysis software, featuring various tools that help
analyzing FRAP datasets, such as

* Import FRAP datasets from timelapse experiments and analyze image data with various options such as
	* various filters
	* background substraction
	* illumination correction
* Simulate the FRAP experiment with exact interpolated initial conditions
* Fit simulated experiment to analyzed data and extract diffusion coefficient
* Statistical analysis of fitting results
* Hierarchical data structure making data exchange/sharing easy
* Comprehensive GUI, making almost all PyFRAP tools available

I have tried to keep the API short but clear. If it is unclear, don't hesitate to mail.
