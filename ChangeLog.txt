Replace backslashes in gmshBin path to slashes so os.system call and 
PATH export works properly in pyfrp_gmsh_module.getGmshBin().

TODO:
	
	- Data structure:
		- We might want to move away from saving to pickle files. IDEA: 
			- molecule files do not save anymore list of embryos but just list of path to embryo files.
			- whenever embryo is needed, molecule calls getEmbryo and thus loading file. This also happens
			  user clicks on gui on embryo
			- Could also include a loadAll option. 
	- GUI integration:
		- mesh merging
		- Simulation visualization
		- Geometry visualization
		- Multiple plotting functions
		- Embryo slicing
		- Simulation to image export
		- In general when plot command is called, ask if plotting should be done in current axis.
		- Add plot modifier from PyFDAP
		- Add additional plotting functions
		- Move all plotting functionalities in GUI to Plotting MB
		- In showObjPropsInBar, if array is longer than maxLength, write sth like "array/list of shape"
		- Get embryo/molecule compression saving running again.
		- Include 2D geometries, e.g. allow dim setting for custom geometries.
	- Might be faster in analysis if we load all files at first, put them in common numpy array, apply all image manupulation steps
	  and finally grab ROIs via c=imgs[idxs,:]
	- pyfrp_gmsh_geometry.ruledSurface should store more than a single lineLoop but rather have a lineLoops list.
	- Need to add pyfrp_gmsh_geometry.planeSurface class.
	- Speed-up via trillionos
	- simulation.showIC via vtk
	- In GUI, when selecting fnFlatten, we need to make sure that we add slash
